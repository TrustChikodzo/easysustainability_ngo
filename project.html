                        countries and their compatibility with their climate commitments. Furthermore, we plan on
                        advocating for policy changes to make renewable energy more accessible and sustain the
                        development of new renewable energy projects, as well as educating young students and adults
                        on energy transition and technologies through podcasts, publications, workshops, and
                        conferences. Our final target for this year in the field of renewable energy is to consult and
                        educate on solar tiles and the adoption of residential CHP to offset energy prices and boost
                        energy independence in the EU.

                        help increase sustainability. Also, we are looking forward in the next 6 months to collaborate with
                        farmers and other stakeholders to find practical solutions that benefit both the environment and
                        local communities, such as the repurposing of abandoned buildings in the district into an
